  "title": "Refund and Credits Guide 2.0",
  "introduction": "We do refunds and credits for customers every day as agents and leads. There are many different scenarios that you will come across that need to be handled differently, depending on the situation. This guide will go over the different types of refunds you will do, how to handle each one, and best practices on what to do and what not to do.\n\nCreated by Alexandra Schmidt & Michelle Radowich\n\n\u00a9 For Credits and Refunds, US/PH/DR agents all have a limit of $50. Agents may now process the refunds and add the credits EVEN IF IT IS OVER THEIR LIMIT, \n\n\n\nEXCEPTION: Agents can refund passes Pre-Arrival no matter what the amount. (Unless it\u2019s a Season Pass or the pass has cancellation restrictions)\n\n\n\n@ Please be sure to ALWAYS confirm the name of the person you are speaking with and make sure that it matches the name on the pass. If the customer calling is NOT the account holder, we need to let them know we do need the account holder\u2019s permission before we can process any refund or credit to their account, so they may need to call back.\n\nLi) Remember, we do NOT price match when helping a customer to rebook. We do not give credit on top of a refund, unless the customer has had two or more Oversolds in the same day. If they have, then you may offer $5-$10 in credit for the frustration and inconvenience.\n\nRemember that we should never offer the customer credit in circumstances like this. Let them ask for credit first.\n\n\u00a9 As of 09/11/24, we are no longer asking customers to provide proof of alternate parking in order to refund their parking pass. If they offer to send in a copy of their receipt or screenshot of their charge, that is fine.\nWhile we can now refund parking passes for immediate refund needs, please be sure to do your due diligence and check the location to see if there are other passes cancelled for the same reason, if a customer has rebooked a new pass or try calling the location to confirm.\nIf a customer is requesting a refund for any reason over the phone, do your best to handle the case and refund if you are able to or get approval to refund if it is over your limit. Please be sure to direct them to https://go.parkwhiz.com/refund for all future refunds. If the customer has already filled out the form, please find the form and merge the tickets, then handle it right away.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to the refund policy and these passes fall under the Non-Refundable status:\n- Passes with AXS as the MOR are Non-Refundable per AXS TOS\n- Passes with SeatGeek as the MOR are Non-Refundable\n- Passes bought on Stubhub are Non-Refundable per Stubhub\u2019s TOS. (Usually these are reseller passes)\n- Reseller passes are non-refundable even with proof (as of 09/23/24) The only exceptions are Seller Cancellations and Event Cancellations. We can refund reseller passes if a seller reaches out and requests it and/or if the event is cancelled.\no Reroute to a different location because the original cannot accommodate will also be considered a Seller Cancellation.\n- Some sellers/locations have Special Refund Handling procedures (Such as Diamond Parking and locations that require approval by the NYC team) so be sure to double-check the location\u2019s Admin page or reach out to the Lead on Duty if you get an error (red refund restriction) when trying to refund a pass in Admin (Special Refund Handling will be discussed later in this guide)\n\n\u00a9 We do NOT give a customera credit in lieu of a refund for any reason. If a customer is insisting,  as we may be able to make an exception depending on the situation.\n\n\u00a9 Refunds and Credits cannot be given if ithas been more than 14 days from the end date of the parking pass. Please reach out to the Lead on Duty if the customer has an issue with this and  to do a One Time Courtesy credit or tolerance refund.\n\nEXCEPTION: Duplicate passes can be refunded even if its been more than 14 days from the end date of the parking pass. (Follow any Special Handling Instructions for the location)\n\n\u00a9 We are NOT able to refund any payment the customer made on-site since we can NOT refund money that was not paid to Parkwhiz. You can give the customer the phone number of the location and they would have to discuss that with them \n\n\u00a9 For passes where a customer has used a promo code and we need to issue a one time courtesy (OTC) credit, you can credit the full base price since most promo codes can only be used once. If you aren\u2019t sure how much credit to give, ask a lead in the Vortex.",

(Add to the partial refund sheet w/seller debit)\nIn general, parking passes can be canceled pre-arrival; HOWEVER, it\u2019s still a good habit to check the admin notes before doing that, as there are some exceptions. Agent and Lead refund limits DO NOT apply to Pre-arrival cancellations.\n\n@ EXCEPTION: Reseller Passes (Marked as Non-Refundable in Admin) CANNOT be cancelled/refunded as Pre-Arrival\nPLEASE NOTE: This seller has a FIRM NO REFUND POLICY and thus we should not process any refunds (their policy is stated in the Location Description and Parking Disclaimers fields). This applies to refund requests that are made after the cancellation cutoff (midnight day-of-event) / before arrival - and after arrival (post parking start time).\nThat said, please submit all refund requests to Brandon Flynn (bflynn@tampasportsauthority.com) and Ashley Greenfeld (agreenfeld@tampasportsauthority.com) so that TSA may take care of these customers in other ways.\n\nExample of Admin note barring certain refunds\nLimited Cancellation: Cancel this booking for free up to 10 hours before start time\n\nContact Us\n888-472-7594\n\nExample of cancellation policy verbiage on parking pass"

These are usually valet locations and the validation method involves showing the pass to the attendant.\n\nWhen an attendant should be there to take a customer\u2019s pass but the customer says that there was no one when they arrived, there are a few things to verify before we refund the pass.\n\n\u00ab Double check that the customer is at the correct location via the \u201cHow To Find It\u201d section of their pass, using the pictures provided on the pass and even Google Maps if necessary.\n- Ask the customer how long they have been waiting. Sometimes the attendant may be away helping another customer with their car or they may be on a break. Typically, if a customer has waited more than 15-20 mins and no attendant has shown up, then this would be eligible for a refund.\n- Try calling the garage and see if you can get a hold of an attendant in case they may have stepped away for a moment. You can use the number provided in Admin or if there isn\u2019t one available, try Googling for one. If the Point of Contact (POC) for the location has a phone number listed in Admin, you can also try calling them if you are unable to get hold of the location.\n- See if the customer has rebooked a new pass or offer to help them find another location nearby that you can rebook them at while on the phone with them and once they have rebooked, the original pass can be refunded.\n- If unable to verify with the location and no other passes have been refunded due to there being No Attendant, then you can refund without proof if it is under $50.

You can locate the amenities a location offers on their Admin page under the Pricing tab, at the bottom of the customer\u2019s parking pass, and on the website by looking up the location\u2019s details.\n\nExamples of possible Amenity icons on parking passes - Example of Re-entry Allowed.\n- Shuttle Service: This is usually found at locations that offer airport parking and have shuttles that take customers to the airport and pick them up at the airport.\n- Tailgating Allowed: This means that the location allows customers to tailgate, which is to cook and/or have a small party in the parking lot, usually during sporting events.\n- Unobstructed: This means that when the customer is parked they will not have any cars parked that block them in and prevent them from getting out.\n- Attended: This means that there is an attendant on site usually to validate a customer\u2019s parking pass.\n- Handicap Accessible: This means that the location has handicap-accessible parking. We cannot guarantee customers a handicapped spot, as they are usually first come, first serve, so it is best to give the location\u2019s phone number for the customer to reach out if they would like to find out more about the location\u2019s handicapped parking.\n\u00ab Indoor: This means that the location offers covered parking and protection from rain and snow.\n- Printed Pass: This means that the location requires customers to have their parking pass printed out and usually displayed on their dashboard for validation.\n- Re-entry Allowed: This means that the location allows customers to leave and return multiple times on the same pass.\n\nCustomers who book multi-day passes usually are looking for this amenity.\n\n\u00a9 If a location or pass does NOT explicitly show the Re-Entry amenity and mention that Re-entry is allowed on the customer\u2019s_ pass or in the location\u2019s Parkwhiz Detail page, then Re-entry is NOT offered. Customers can filter locations by Re-Entry in the Parkwhiz App on their smartphones but NOT on the website.\n- Restrooms: This means there are on-site restrooms for customers to use.\n- Security: This means that the location has security on-site keeping an eye on things.\n- Valet: This means the location offers valet service, where they will park a customer's car for them and then bring it to them when they return to pick it up.\n+ Vehicle Charging: This means that the location offers on-site charging stations for electric vehicles, such as Teslas.\nIf a customer arrives at a location and they booked it specifically because it showed that it offered a particular amenity, then when they arrive the location does not have it, then we can refund them as Amenity Missing but there are a few steps we have to follow first which are outlined below.\n\nExamples of this would be: if a location offers Vehicle Charging but then says they do not have charging stations for electric vehicles or they are not working; if the customer booked at a location near an airport that offers shuttle service but they do not or their shuttle is out of service; or if the location says it allows tailgating then refuses to let a customer tailgate.\nBefore issuing a refund as Amenity Missing, please do the following steps:\n- Escalate the missing amenity to the Digital Solutions Implementations team via a Freshdesk Ticket to implementations@parkwhiz.com (formerly the Merchandising Team)\n\u00ab Once they have confirmed that the amenity is missing, then you may go ahead and refund the customer's pass as Amenity Missing.

We will usually refund a customer's pass when they have a particularly bad experience, though some of them may takea bit of investigation before we can issue the refund.\n\nIf an attendant is being very rude or abusive to a customer, we should escalate the situation to the location\u2019s POC or NYC team for further investigation. If the customer left without parking, .\nIf a customer returns to pick up their car and finds it damaged or some of their items are missing, we want to remind the customer that ParkWhiz is not responsible for damage or theft since we do not own or operate the garages; however, we will do all we can to act as a mediator between the customer and the garage to help find a resolution. Agents should NOT refund for poor experience \n\nIf we refund the customer's pass in the case of damage or theft claims, then we would be assuming liabilty which we do not want to do. We would want to give the customer the phone number for the location and/or emails listed in Admin that specifically pertain to damage and theft claims. Remember, DO NOT give out the POC\u2019s email or phone number that shows in Admin.\n\n\u00a9 The customer must file a report with the garage for the damage or theft \u2014 which is best done before they leave the lot! -\u2014 and if they wish, they can also file a police report. We can send them an email through Freshdesk using the #damage-or-theft-claim canned response where the customer can reply with the paperwork they have.\n- Sometimes a customer tells us that they have been waiting a long time to either enter a location to park or while trying to leave. Fifteen (15) minutes or more would usually be considered a long wait time. Sometimes it is understandable that attendants at locations may get busy or backed up a bit, so we would want to try calling the location to see if we can find out why there may be a long wait time. Again, we still need to document the issue and escalate to a Lead prior to proceeding.\n\no If acustomer has a complaint, BUT does end up parking - we should attempt to avoid a refund depending on the situation and perhaps offer some credit. A small credit such as $5 to $10 would be typical for most situations."

If they couldn't park or chose not to park at the location, then you can try and help them find another place to park that can better accommodate the hours they need.\n\nscenario, you will want to  and ask them to confirm with the seller what their hours are so we can see if this information needs to be changed on our end.\nBEFORE issuing a refund as Inaccurate Hours, please do the following steps:\n- Ask the customer if there is any sign or documentation of the hours for the location. If yes, please ask them to send a picture to help@parkwhiz.com or they can also send it via Chat.\n- If there is no sign, please try calling the location to verify the hours that the customer told you with an attendant or manager.\n- If the customer is no longer at the location, please create a ticket for DSS - Seller Support to verify the hours of the location.\n- If Seller Support confirms that we have the wrong hours, then you can follow up with the customer and issue a refund of their parking pass.

They may refuse to honor one of our passes, claim that they have no idea what Parkwhiz is, or the customer's vehicle may be too big to fit.\nThese are just a few examples of when an attendant on-site may refuse one of our customers, though keep in mind there may be other reasons as well.\n\nWhen an attendant refuses to honor a Parkwhiz pass or says that the location does not work with Parkwhiz, send a ticket to the Digital Solutions Support - Seller Support at digitalsupport@parkwhiz.com so they can reach out to the seller to confirm.\nIf the customer claims that an attendant was very rude or abusive to them as well, then you would also want to escalate the behavior part to the appropriate POC or NYC tean, if the situation warrants it.\nBefore issuing a refund as Attendant Refused, please do the following steps:\n- Make sure that the customer is at the correct location by utilizing the How To Find It Section of their parking pass as well as Google Maps.\n\u00bb Check the bookings at the location for that day and see if there are other passes that have been refunded/canceled due to the attendant refusing to take the pass.\n- Try to call the location and speak with an attendant or manager to confirm if they are refusing the customer and if so, why.\n- If you are unable to verify with the location, check if the customer rebooked a new pass or help them rebook a new pass while they are on the phone with you. You can then refund the customer\u2019s original parking pass.\n\n@ If the customer says that they were refused due to an Oversize reason or because of the type of car they were driving, ask the MAKE AND MODEL of their car. We can Google the vehicle and find out the height and length. Check to see if there are any disclaimers for the location saying they do not take certain vehicles or if they have a height restriction. If they do and the customer\u2019s vehicle falls under the disclaimer, we cannot refund though we can offer an OTC credit."

If it is a customer error, please use \u201cConfirmed Rebook\u201d instead.\n\nEvery now and then a customer ends up with more than one parking pass and they only need one. A customer may also call in because they saw they were charged twice (or multiple times) and they want to find out why.\nTo resolve these we need to verify that there is more than one pass for the exact same location, time, date, and/or event. To be considered a \u201cduplicate,\u201d the passes should also have been purchased within minutes of each other. If there is more than one pass that has all the same details, then we have established that there is some sort of duplication.\n\nThe next step is to determine whether the duplication is caused by tech/bug error or by user error.

Ask clarifying questions to understand how the \u201cduplicate\u201d was made - did they receive an error, use a bad email, etc.\n\nRemember to check the dates on the passes. If they are both for upcoming events, then you can go ahead and refund one of them, just please be sure to verify with the customer which pass you are refunding and which one will still be active so they can be sure to use the correct one at their future event.\n\nIf the dates of the passes are for the same date and the customer is at the location already, then advise them to fill out the refund form once they have exited since it can be hard to Know which of the two passes the customer may have used, and we do not want to risk canceling the wrong one and then the customer will have trouble getting out after their event or have to pay on-site."

It is not the same as paid additional (ie. early arrival, late departure, missing early bird, oversize/supersize).\nIt may also happen because:\n- They arrived prior to their start time or exited after their end time, so they had to pay for that extra time at the garage\u2019s on-site rates.\n- They may be charged an oversize fee on-site by the attendant.\n- Sometimes we just don\u2019t know for sure why they may be charged and have to pay again on-site.\n\nWhen this happens, we want to apologize that they had to pay on-site and try to ask them some questions to see if we can find out why.\n- What time did they arrive and/or what time did they leave?\n- What is the make and model of their vehicle?\n- Did an attendant tell them why they were being charged extra?\n- Did they violate re-entry?

      "content": "There will be cases where a seller will reach out to Parkwhiz and ask us to cancel bookings made at their location/s because they are unable to accommodate them due to a change in operating hours, special events or there was an issue with the price offered for passes on the Parkwhiz website and/or app.\nThis is the one Refund reason that CX agents will never end up using because it will be the seller reaching out to Parkwhiz about canceling bookings and not a customer. When this happens, customers are sent an email about the cancellation, but they may call in to find out more about why their pass was canceled.\n\n0 If you are trying to find out more about a Seller Cancellation, reach out to the Lead on Duty and we can escalate or try to get in touch with the agent that canceled the pass to see if we can find out more information for you to tell the customer.\n\nCustomers likely will be upset about Seller Cancellations so do your best to be empathetic while letting the customer know that it is beyond Parkwhiz\u2019s control since we are a third party listing service for the locations and do not own and run them. If a seller contacts us and asks us to cancel/refund or rebook customers, then we have no choice but to do as they ask.\nThere are a few ways to tell if a pass was canceled at the request of the seller. In the screenshot below, you can see that it was canceled by Xel and the reason stated is \u201cThis booking was canceled at the request of the seller because it could not be accommodated\u201d."

      "title": "Disclaimers",
      "content": "Some parking passes will have disclaimers on them for various things that a customer needs to be aware of both when booking and when getting to the garage. Some examples of disclaimers you will see on a parking pass are:\n\u00ab Vehicle drop off and pick up times\n- Vehicle size restrictions, such as maximum height.\n- On-site oversize fees.\n- Location unable to take certain types of cars such as Teslas.\n\nIn cases where there is a disclaimer on the pass and on the location information on the website when booking, and a customer violated this disclaimer, then they are_not eligible for a refund since they did not follow the instructions on their pass.\nThe reason for this is because it would not be fair of us to penalize the location for a customer's error. While we cannot refund them, we can give them a one time courtesy credit and help to educate and empower the customer on the disclaimers so that they are aware of them going forward when they book a pass next time.\nYou may need to doa little detective work with the customer to verify if they violated a disclaimer. Be sure to check the pass carefully for any disclaimers and depending on the issue, you will want to ask a few clarifying questions to determine if they violated a disclaimer or not.\n- Ask them the make and model of their vehicle to see if it is considered an oversized vehicle or if it is larger than the maximum height restrictions. You may need to Google the type of vehicle in order to find the dimensions, then you can determine if it is bigger than the maximum height allowance or considered an oversized car.\n\n@ An oversized vehicle is one that is at least 180 inches (15'1\") long and/or 70 inches (5'10\") high. Any vehicle that meets or exceeds these dimensions is subject to the oversized vehicle charge. If the charge isn't included in the booking price, then this fee is assessed and paid onsite.\nPlease refer to the What is an Oversize Vehicle? page of the Parkwhiz Knowledge Base for more information on Oversize and Supersize Vehicles. You can also provide the customer with this link over the phone or via email.\n\u00bb Ask them what time they arrived and/or left the garage. You want to verify that they were within the time frame not only of their parking pass but also within the garage\u2019s operating hours for pick-up times. Some locations offer overnight parking but theyare not open 24/7 so they will have a disclaimer stating that vehicles must be picked up between certain hours during the week or weekend.\n- If a disclaimer discloses details such as height requirements, operating hours, etc that were simply overlooked, a one time courtesy credit is all we can do. The seller shouldn't be punished for something that is clearly indicated on the pass or in the location description before booking. If you are in doubt or the customer pushes back on the credit, please consult the Lead on duty.\nBelow you will see a couple of screenshots that show examples of disclaimers that you will see on several different locations."

We can NOT partially refund these.\n\nOn-site issues (oversold, attendant refused, etc) should be documented using the same procedures outlined in this guide. If they rebooked or there are other passes cancelled for the same reason, etc. reach out to a Lead to process.\n\nIf the customer parked but left with time remaining (violated re-entry, left early, etc) we must do the following:\n- Confirm they have already left the location - the pass will be cancelled and if they have not left, this will cause an issue for them.\n'Y If Yes, collect more specific information {arrival date/time and exit date/time) and forward to a Lead\nvy What if the customer has not left the location?\n\nIf they have not left, please advise them to contact us once they have actually exited for review (do not promise any refund). We do not process anything based on a customer saying when they will exit.\nvy What about flight cancellations?\n\nGroupon customers need to be referred to Groupon. In all other cases, follow the steps noted above and process accordingly.

In some rare cases, a partial refund may be possible; however, this would need approval.\n\nWhat about cruise parking?\nFor cancellation of multi-day passes for any CRUISE parking, please direct the customer to the location for assistance. We can advise that contacting the location directly typically speeds up the process, as it allows the complaint to be communicated directly with the operator, who can then reach out to us with approval. You can provide the phone number in admin (DO NOT provide the POC\u2019s email or phone number).
